    <h1>Breaking into Bioinformatics: My Journey and Advice</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Published July 2025 · By Aarushi Gajri</p>

    <p>When I started my undergraduate degree at IIT Mandi in Bioengineering, I had no idea I'd be presenting AI models for protein–ligand interaction at Georgia Tech a few years later. Like many students, I found bioinformatics through a mix of curiosity, coding, and a desire to understand life at the molecular level.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Find your curiosity</h2>
    <p>It began with a fascination for how genes and mutations work. My exposure to genomic tools and biological data in class sparked the urge to explore further.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Build your skills</h2>
    <p>I dove into Python, R, bash, and later PyTorch and deep learning. My internships at Elucidata, UBC, and MedGenome gave me real-world exposure to variant calling, ML pipelines, and disease prediction models.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Create and contribute</h2>
    <p>At Georgia Tech, I worked on MoRF prediction using LLMs and BiLSTMs, presented at the Suddath Symposium, and interned at Regeneron on BCR repertoire analysis. These projects taught me to think like a scientist—and engineer solutions that matter.</p>

    <h2>Advice for newcomers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with biology or computer science, but explore both.</li>
      <li>Learn basic genomics, statistics, and data visualization.</li>
      <li>Get hands-on: build pipelines, join internships, contribute to research.</li>
      <li>Ask “why” and “how” relentlessly. Curiosity is your compass.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Bioinformatics is the future of personalized medicine, drug discovery, and systems biology. If you're passionate about using AI to decode biology, you're in the right place.</p>
