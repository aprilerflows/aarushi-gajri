      <p>Bioinformatics sits at the crossroads of life science and data science—where we apply algorithms, statistics, and machine learning to understand biological systems. My own path began in 2019 at IIT Mandi, studying bioengineering. I was fascinated by how genetic data could reveal disease mechanisms, but I lacked coding skills. Over the next six years, I built a toolbox of computational methods, pursued internships, and dove deep into machine learning frameworks tailored for biology.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Build a Strong Foundation</h2>
      <p>Start with introductory courses in biology and programming. I learned Python and R to manipulate genomic datasets, then tackled statistics and Linux command‐line. Early internships at Elucidata and MedGenome exposed me to real-world pipelines—somatic variant calling, cell deconvolution, and deep-learning phenotyping. Those months taught me to write robust, reproducible code and to appreciate the complexities of biological data.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Specialize in ML for Biology</h2>
      <p>During my Mitacs Globalink internship at UBC, I designed workflows to annotate CpG methylation patterns linked to aging and sex differences. That project introduced me to TensorFlow and neural network interpretability. Later, at Georgia Tech, I developed an NLP pipeline using GPT-4 to mine Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) from the literature—combining prompt engineering with regex parsing to curate a domain‐specific database.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Expand to Structural & Systems Biology</h2>
      <p>My Regeneron internship pushed me into immune repertoire analysis. I built graph-based algorithms to cluster B-cell receptors by VDJ lineage and infer affinity maturation paths. This experience showed me the power of network science in immunology and led to my current passion: generative models that predict molecular interactions at the residue level.</p>

      <h2>Advice for Aspiring Bioinformaticians</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Learn Python & R:</strong> Essential for data wrangling, statistics, and ML libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Work on Open Datasets:</strong> Practice with TCGA, 1000 Genomes, BioLiP, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Pursue Internships:</strong> Real pipelines, domain knowledge, and code validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Master Version Control:</strong> Git & GitHub for collaboration and reproducibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Curious:</strong> Read papers, attend workshops, and contribute to open-source.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Bioinformatics is more than coding; it’s solving biological puzzles with computational creativity. Whether you aim to design novel proteins, predict disease risk, or chart immune landscapes, the key is to marry rigorous data skills with a deep love for biology. Your next discovery awaits at that interface—go explore it!</p>
